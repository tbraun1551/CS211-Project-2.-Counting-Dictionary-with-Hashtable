 
Whos there 
 
Nay answer me Stand and unfold yourself 
 
Long live the King 
 
Barnardo 
 
He 
 
You come most carefully upon your hour 
 

Tis now struck twelve Get thee to bed Francisco 
 
For this relief much thanks Tis bitter cold And I am sick at heart 
 
Have you had quiet guard 
 
Not a mouse stirring 
 
Well good night If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus The rivals of my watch bid them make haste 
 
I think I hear them Stand ho Who is there 
 
Friends to this ground 
 
And liegemen to the Dane 
 
Give you good night 
 
O farewell honest soldier Who hath relieved you 
 
Barnardo hath my place Give you good night 
 
Holla Barnardo 
 
Say what is Horatio there 
 
A piece of him 
 
Welcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus 
 
What has this thing appeared again tonight 
 
I have seen nothing 
 
Horatio says tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it
